# Tequila MongoDB PHP Library (driver library)

The Tequila MongoDB project is a library, which provides the high-level abstraction around the new low-level [PHP MongoDB driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver), e.g.
schema-management, abstractions around connections, databases, collections, indexes etc.

The library works on PHP 5.6.0 or higher, PHP 7.0 or higher, MongoDB 3.2 or higher. It also requires the PHP `mongodb` extension (the MongoDB driver for PHP) to be installed.

The library is under an active development and is NOT ready for use right now. The first release is planned for October 12, 2016.
Contributions are appreciated.

The documentation will come soon.
