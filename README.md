# Tequilla MongoDB abstracton layer for PHP (driver library)

The Tequilla MongoDB project is a library, which provides the high-level abstraction around the new low-level [PHP MongoDB driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver).
In addition to schema-management, abstractions around connections, databases, collections, indexes etc., this library provides 
the event system, based on [Symfony Event Dispatcher](https://github.com/symfony/event-dispatcher) component.

The library works on PHP 5.6.0 or higher, PHP 7.0 or higher, MongoDB 3.0 or higher. It also requires the PHP `mongodb` extension (the MongoDB driver for PHP) to be installed.

The library is under an active development and is NOT ready for use right now. The first release is planned for August 1, 2016.
Contributions are appreciated.

The documentation will come soon.
